# Toops Multiplayer
This is an attempt at making a Multiplayer leaderboard for the HTML5 game Toops.
You can find Toops at [plays.org](https://plays.org/toops), and I'm using this version to develop this script.
I will open-source the PHP server software for running the leaderboard as well. That will be in the `server/` directory.

# Premise
The idea is that this is a game which could use a leaderboard. I figured that's easy enough to implement. I figured I could build a UserScript to do this.
